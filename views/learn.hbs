        <h3>U Value</h3>
        <p id="u-value">To put it simply U value is heat loss in BTU through 1 square foot of material. R value which
          you
          commonly see for insulation measures the heat transfer resistence of a material, the higher the better. With U
          value the lower the better. You cannot measure R-value of a window since it is a measure of a single material
          and a window has many different components. Thus U value is a measure of all components (frame, glass,
          weatherstripping, air leakage, etc. A brand new window will have a U value of 0.3 while an old wood frame
          single
          pane window will be 1.5</p>

        <h3>BTU</h3>
        <p id="british-thermal-unit">The amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water by 1 degree
          Fahrenheit. About the size of a 16oz water bottle. Without getting too technical 1,000 watt space heater at
          100% efficiency creates 3,420 BTU's per hour. Your typical space heater has a high setting of 1,500 watts and
          low of 750 watts.</p>

        <h3>Coefficient Of Performance</h3>
        <p id="co-of-perf">Used to measure the efficiency of a heater or AC. The COP of electric resistance heat 1. A
          single watt will create 3.42 BTU's. The COP of an air conditioner is around 3, much more efficient than
          electric resistance heating. a 12,000 BTU air conditioner will use under 1000 watts, while a 12,000 BTU
          electric heater uses around 3,000</p>
